# DATA WAREHOUSING

The process of collecting the data from various sources and structuring it in a way that it provides valuable insights to business organisations. It is the single source of truth.

## [What is Data Warehousing?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse)

Data warehouse, or enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a large collection of structured data that helps organisation make the right decisions. It is a system that aggregates data from different sources into a single, central, consistent data store to support data analysis, data mining.

## Key Components of a Data Warehouse

#### 1. Data Sources:

- These are the different systems from which data is extracted.

#### 2. ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load):

- These tasks include the simple transformation of data to prepare data for entry into the warehouse.

  - Extract: Data is extracted from various sources.
  - Transform: Extracted data is cleaned, transformed, and organized into a suitable format.
  - Load: Transformed data is loaded into the data warehouse.

#### 3. Data Storage:

- This is the central repository where transformed data is stored.
- It is often structured in a way that optimizes query performance.

#### 4. Metadata:

- Metadata describes the data warehouse's contents, structure, and rules.
- It includes data about data, such as source systems, data transformations etc.

#### 5. Data Marts:

- Theses are the subsets of data warehouse.
- They provide a more focused view of data relevant to a particular group within the organisation, example: financial data, customer data etc.

## Steps in Data Warehousing

1. Extraction of data - A large amount of data is gathered from various sources.

2. Cleaning of data - The data is scanned for errors, and any error found is either corrected or excluded.

3. Conversion of data - After being cleaned, the format is changed from the database to a warehouse format.

4. Storing in a warehouse - Once converted to the warehouse format, the data stored in a warehouse goes through processes such as consolidation and summarization to make it easier and more coordinated to use.

## Advantages of Data Warehousing

1. Enhanced Business Intelligence.
2. Increase in the productivity of decision-makers.
3. Improved Query Performance.

## Challenges in Data Warehousing

1. Cost.
2. Maintenance.
3. Complexity.
